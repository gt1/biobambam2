.TH BAMMARKDUPLICATES 1 "July 2013" BIOBAMBAM
.SH NAME
bammarkduplicates - mark duplicate reads/alignments in BAM files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B bammarkduplicates
[options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
bammarkduplicates reads a BAM file containing alignments computed by an
aligner, marks duplicate reads/alignments using the coordinates of the alignments and writes the
marked alignments to a BAM file. By default input is via standard input and
output via standard output. Duplication metrics are provided on the standard
error channel by default. bammarkduplicates scans the input BAM file twice,
it is thus of benefit to set the I key (described below) to give the name of
an input file. If the input BAM file is given via standard input, then a
copy of the input will be stored in a temporary file during the first run
for processing in a second run.
.PP
The following key=value pairs can be given:
.PP
.B I=<stdin>: 
name of the input file (input is read from standard input if not set). This
key can be given multiple times. If it is given multiple times, then the
input files need to be in coordinate sorted order and will be merged for
output such that the output will be coordinate sorted.
.PP
.B O=<stdout>: 
name of the output file (output is written to standard output if not set)
.PP
.B M=<stderr>: 
name of the metrics file (metrics are written to standard error if not set)
.PP
.B tmpfile=<filename>: 
prefix for temporary files. By default the temporary files are created in the current directory
.PP
.B level=<-1|0|1|9>:
set compression level of the output BAM file. Valid
values are
.IP -1:
zlib/gzip default compression level
.IP 0:
uncompressed
.IP 1:
zlib/gzip level 1 (fast) compression
.IP 9:
zlib/gzip level 9 (best) compression
.PP
.B markthreads=<1>: 
Number of threads used during marking duplicate alignments.
.PP
.B verbose=<1>:
Valid values are
.IP 1:
print progress report on standard error
.IP 0:
do not print progress report
.PP
.B mod=<1048576>:
print progress after processing every mod'th input read/alignment (default is 1M)
.PP
.B rewritebam=<0|1|2>:
compression type of the temporary file stored if I key is not given (input is via standard input). Valid values are
.IP 0:
temporary data is compressed using snappy (if available, see http://code.google.com/p/snappy/)
.IP 1:
gzip/BAM, recompress input and store it as a BAM file
.IP 2:
copy, produce a 1/1 copy of the input stream as a temporary file
.PP
.B rewritebamlevel=<-1|0|1|9>:
compression level of temporary BAM file if rewritebam is 1 (see level key for possible values).
.PP
.B colhashbits=<20>:
base two logarithm of the size of the hash table used for collation (the
default value is 18 and should work reasonably well for most input files.
Please see the biobambam paper at arxiv.org/abs/1306.0836 for details).
.PP
.B collistsize=<33554432>:
size of hash table overflow list in bytes (the default is 128MB and should
work reasonably well for most input files. Please see the biobambam paper at 
arxiv.org/abs/1306.0836 for details).
.PP
.B fragbufsize=<50331648>: 
size of each fragment/pair file buffer in bytes (bammarkduplicates uses two
such buffer for detecting duplicates)
.PP
.B rmdup=<0|1>:
sets how duplicates are handled
.IP 0:
duplicates will be retained in the output file and have the duplication flag set
.IP 1:
duplicates will be remove when writing the output file
.PP
.B md5=<0|1>:
md5 checksum creation for output file. Valid values are
.IP 0:
do not compute checksum. This is the default.
.IP 1:
compute checksum. If the md5filename key is set, then the checksum is
written to the given file. If the md5filename key is not given but set O key
is set the checksum will be written as output file name with .md5 appended.
If md5filename and O are unset, then no checksum will be computed.
.PP
.B md5filename
file name for md5 checksum if md5=1.
.PP
.B index=<0|1>:
compute BAM index for output file. Valid values are
.IP 0:
do not compute BAM index. This is the default.
.IP 1:
compute BAM index. If the indexfilename key is set, then the BAM index is
written to the given file. If the indexfilename key is not given but set O key
is set the checksum will be written as output file name with .bai appended.
If indexfilename and O are unset, then no BAM index will be computed.
.PP
.B indexfilename
file name for BAM index if index=1.
